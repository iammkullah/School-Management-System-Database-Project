# School Management System Database Project
Many school managers have been lacking the opportunity to manage their administrative activities using technological advancements such as mobile phones, tablets, computers, and the internet instead they are using manual filling system. Currently, it is difficult for school administration to know in real-time how many students are attending classes, the parentâ€™s contact details of each student, or generating reports on school fee payments for each student. 

For that reason, we have proposed a computerized school management a system which will improve the efficiency of administrative service such as entering student details, tracking student attendance, and managing many other student, parents, and teachers-related data.
